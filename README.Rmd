## IMPORTANT NOTES

:warning: This code is released with no support. Please submit any questions or bugs as [issues](https://github.com/mrc-ide/coop/issues) and we will try to address them as quickly as possible.

:warning: This code is under active development and so parameter names and behaviours will change without notice.

Coop is a generalised heuristic for budget constrained optimisations using simulated annealing. You can use coop to search for optimal combinations of scenarios (e.g. intervention mixes across districts) which minimise a target outcome (e.g. cases). Optimal outcomes can be budget constrained at multiple levels (e.g. the solution must comply with global and country budgets).

## Installation

You can install coop from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mrc-ide/coop")
```
