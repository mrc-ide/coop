# coop

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

Coop is a generalised approach to budget constrained optimisations using simulated annealing. You can use coop to find optimal combinations of scenarios (e.g. intervention mixes across districts) which minimise a target outcome (e.g. malaria cases). Optimal outcomes can be budget constrained at multiple levels (e.g. the solution must comply with global, regional and country budgets).

## Installation

You can install coop from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("pwinskill/coop")
```
