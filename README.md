coop
====

Coop is a generalised approach to budget constrained optimisations using simulated annealing. You can use coop to find optimal combinations of scenarios (e.g. intervention mixes across districts) which minimise a target outcome (e.g. malaria cases). Optimal outcomes can be budget constrained at multiple levels (e.g. the solution must comply with global, regional and country budgets).

Installation
------------

You can install coop from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pwinskill/coop")
```
