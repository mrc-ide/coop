# coop

[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there
has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the
public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

Coop is a generalised approach to budget constrained optimisations using
simulated annealing. You can use coop to find optimal combinations of
scenarios (e.g. intervention mixes across districts) which minimise a
target outcome (e.g. malaria cases). Optimal outcomes can be budget
constrained at multiple levels (e.g. the solution must comply with
global, regional and country budgets).

## Installation

You can install coop from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("pwinskill/coop")
```
