Title: Budget COnstrained OPtimisation using simmulated annealing
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Peter Winskill
Maintainer: Peter Winskill <p.winskill@imperial.ac.uk>
Description: Coop is a generalised approach to budget constrained optimisations using simulated annealing. 
    You can use coop to find optimal combinations of scenarios (e.g. intervention mixes across districts) which minimise a target outcome (e.g. malaria cases).
